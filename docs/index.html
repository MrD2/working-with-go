		<h1>Working with Go</h1>

<p>Working with Go is a set of example programs in Go (golang) to get an experienced programmer familiar with Go. The Go language is often referred to as golang to help searches.</p>

<p>This initially started out as a full fledged book, but I found the real value was in all the examples; the text and descriptions were simple enough to include in the code as comments. Also I think the descriptions explain better in context of the code.</p>

<h2>Install Go</h2>

<p>Go is distributed as a binary on the major platforms, Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Windows. It is available for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. See the official <a href="http://golang.org/doc/install">Getting Started with Go</a> page for downloads and more instructions.</p>

<p>Go is available in most Linux package environments as <code>golang</code>.</p>

<h2>Running Go</h2>

<p>Go is a compiled language, you first need to compile program and then run the compiled binary. Go creates a single binary file that includes all necessary dependencies. This is convenient, once a binary is built you can copy and run to any similar system.</p>

<p>Once you have Go installed, you can build a program:</p>

<pre><code>$ go build hello.fo
</code></pre>

<p>This will create the binary <code>hello</code>, you can then run:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./hello
&gt;&gt; Hola Mundo!
</code></pre>

<p>This tutorial will use <code>$</code> as the command prompt, and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> as the output from the program.</p>

<p>Go includes a convenience function which allows you to build/run in a single command, note this does not produce a binary.</p>

<pre><code>$ go run hello.go
&gt;&gt; Hola Mundo!
</code></pre>

<h2>Development Environment</h2>

<p>Go is purposely light-weight and simply, making it quite flexible for just about any set of developer tools. A full blown IDE, such as Eclipse, is rarely used. Most developers opt for their favorite text editor and the terminal to run. This is how I develop on Linux.</p>

<p>My primarily editor is <strong>Vim</strong>, I recommend using <a
href="https://github.com/fatih/vim-go">vim-go</a> package which includes in syntax support, and some convience functions.</p>

<p>Go has two tools that can automatically format your source code to the Go coding standard, <code>gofmt</code> which comes with standard install and <code>goimports</code> which will format and auto adjust import statements as needed.</p>

<p>I highly recommend <code>goimports</code> because Go will not compile if imports are missing or extra. The <code>goimports</code> saves this hassle when adding removing things during development.</p>

<p>Whatever editor you use, I recommend installing and configuring <a
href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports">goimports</a> to automatically run on save.</p>

<p>Install goimports:</p>

<pre><code>$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
</code></pre>

<p>For vim, you can setup to auto run <code>goimports</code> on save using vim-go:</p>

<pre><code>let g:go_fmt_command = &quot;goimports&quot;
</code></pre>

Additions, corrections and any contributions are encouraged, please submit a pull request with your change or an issue for a bug or fix. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go/graphs/contributors">all the contributors</a>!</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>This set of examples assumes a certain level of programming experience and is intended for someone learning the Go language and not someone new to programming altogether.</p>

<p>If you are starting out and want to learn how to program and choose Go as your first language, check out <a href="http://www.golang-book.com/">Learn Programming in Go</a></p>

<p>The official Go language site has a <a href="http://tour.golang.org/">Tour of Go</a> which is an interactive walk through, another good introduction to the language.</p>
