# Working with Go

By Marcus Kazmierczak [mkaz.blog](http://mkaz.blog/), [@mkaz](https://twitter.com/mkaz)

Working with Go is a set of example programs in Go (golang) to get an experienced programmer familiar with Go. The Go language is often referred to as golang to help searches.

## Format Change

This repository was previously just a set of Go programs showing each of the examples, I found myself referencing it often, but more difficult to read the comments, examples, and navigating.

In April 2019, I switched it over to a static site published to https://mkaz.github.io/working-with-go and the site is generated using my [Hastie static site generator](https://github.com/mkaz/hastie), written in Go of course.


I saved the previous repository under the [classic branch](https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go/tree/classic) so you can still browse.

## Resources

This set of examples assumes a certain level of programming experience and is intended for someone learning the Go language and not someone new to programming altogether.

If you are starting out and want to learn how to program and choose Go as your first language, check out [Learn Programming in Go](http://www.golang-book.com/)

The official site has a [Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/) which is an interactive walk through, another good introduction to the language.

I'm also a big fan of [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) which is quite similar.
