Working with Go is a set of examples for Go (golang) to help an experienced programmer become familiar with the Go language. Go is often referred to as golang to help searches.

The site is generated from markdown files in the `pages` directory. Any additions, corrections, suggestions or any contributions are appreciated. You can submit a pull request or an issue for a bug or fix.


Generation is done using [Hastie](https://github.com/mkaz/hastie), a site-generator I wrote in Go, of course. The built files are placed in the `/docs` directory that Github Pages serves from.

Working with Go was started by Marcus Kazmierczak. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go/graphs/contributors">all the contributors</a> who have helped make it even better.


## Resources

This set of examples assumes a base level of programming experience and is intended for someone learning the Go language from another language; not necessarily someone new to programming altogether.

If you are starting out and want to learn how to program and choose Go as your first language, check out [Learn Programming in Go](http://www.golang-book.com/)

The official site has a [Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/) which is an interactive walk through, another good introduction to the language.

I'm also a big fan of [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) which is quite similar.
