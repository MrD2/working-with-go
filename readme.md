## View online at: https://mkaz.blog/working-with-go/

Working with Go is a set of examples for Go (golang) to get an experienced programmer familiar with the Go language. Go is often referred to as golang to help searches.

## Format Change

This repository was previously just a set of Go programs showing each of the examples, I found myself referencing it often, but as Go programs it was difficult to read the comments, examples, and not as easy to navigate.

In April 2019, I switched it over to my site at: https://mkaz.blog/working-with-go

I saved the previous repository under the [classic branch](https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go/tree/classic) so you can still browse.


## Contribute

The site is generated from markdown to WordPress using my [wpsync tool](https://github.com/mkaz/wpsync), written in Go of course.

Working with Go was started by Marcus Kazmierczak. Any additions, corrections, suggestions or any contributions are appreciated. You can submit a pull request or an issue for a bug or fix.

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go/graphs/contributors">all the contributors</a>!


## Resources

This set of examples assumes a base level of programming experience and is intended for someone learning the Go language from another language; not necessarily someone new to programming altogether.

If you are starting out and want to learn how to program and choose Go as your first language, check out [Learn Programming in Go](http://www.golang-book.com/)

The official site has a [Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/) which is an interactive walk through, another good introduction to the language.

I'm also a big fan of [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) which is quite similar.
